INSTRUCTIONS COMMING SOON!

JOHN is a virtual assistante that can talk and help you to do some tasks like open browser, open your desktop applications, simulate a job interview, simulate a frendly conversation like it's your buddy, play a song on Spotify, open a webpage and more. It opens on Safe mode as default so it only responds to your questions when you call JOHN (Like Alexa does). If you want to go to a frendly mode just simply say "Go to conversation mode", but if you want to simulate a job interview you can say "Go to interview mode" and if you want to go back to safe mode just say "Go to safe mode".
